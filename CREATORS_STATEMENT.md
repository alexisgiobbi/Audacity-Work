I had a lot of fun working on this project, and also a lot of challenges, but I think the most difficult part was actually the very beginning portion of drafting. I touched on this in my project introduction, but I had a very loose idea of what I wanted to create and had a hard time nailing it down. I ultimately created a scary story and tried my best to capture a suspenseful mood similar to a story told on an old radio broadcast. I didn’t want it to be too cheesy (at one point I had included this ominous background music that pushed it over the edge) and I didn’t want it to be too serious, because I loved including all those classic horror tropes. 

Most of my time was devoted to the main audio track of the woman, and the dialogue track of the boy. I had to use the noise reduction on both to remove a constant background buzzing. The woman’s audio was almost ten minutes long originally, so I had a lot to cut, split, and rejoin. I also added a reverb effect to any dialogue that the woman or the boy spoke because I noticed it was hard to differentiate between narration and dialogue without it. While making sure the conversation flowed naturally was very tedious, I also got to have a lot of fun pitching up “the boy’s” voice and distorting it slightly to give it an ominous impact. 

However, I think what really sells the scary factor is the added effects. Everything builds up throughout the piece until it culminates into the climax of many loud, chaotic noises. I wanted to include the banging on the door as the very first thing the listener hears, so they know to expect effects worked into the narrative. Originally I had the knocks all on one track, but decided to split them into two so I could pan 100% left and 100% right, giving the illusion of alternate knocking at a front and a back door. 

Some of the sounds, like the crickets and the rain, are there for background noise and a realism aspect. Some of the other sounds, like the footsteps and the door opening at the ending, are used to bump up the scare factor. I worked carefully with the amplify, repeat, and fade in/fade out effects to make all the different kinds of sounds blend together and feel like they came in and faded out naturally. Most of the sounds were too short, so I repeated them as necessary, and used the amplify effect to soften or magnify the audio. I also used the envelope tool to create that crescendo of noise I mentioned earlier. It required a lot of tinkering to discover what worked and what didn’t, but it was also one of my favorite parts of the soundscape. 
I was really nervous to present my draft to the class last week, but it ended up being really encouraging to know that my point was getting across, and it helped me cross the finish line this week!

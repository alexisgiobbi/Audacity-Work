This is of a particular section where knocks at the front and back door are being panned between the left and the right. Originally, I was just working on alternating the knocks at the front and back door by using the left panning on one track and right panning on the other. For my final project, I also incoporated footsteps, static, and the rain. All of the sounds crescendo through the section to create an increasingly chaotic effect.

I wnated cricket sounds and rain to be heard for the section where the door was opened, and then just muffled rain to be heard when the door was closed. I played around with amplify, auto ducking, gain, and fade in/fade out to get my desired effect.

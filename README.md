# Composing-Digital-Media

### Project description

  My project is a scary story retelling that incoporates dialogue and sound effects.
  
  
### Progress so far 

  Update 1: I have four tracks going so far- music, podcast intro, poem, and an effects track. I will be adding many more effects, different music, and a podcast outro.  
  
  Update 2: I really changed around my project! I mentioned last week that I just wasn't really loving the concept of my project, so I switched it to a scary story, rather than a podcast/poem. It's allowed me to play around a lot more. It also gets easier as I go along.
  
 
### Left to do

  I'm about 80% finished. I want to add in 1-2 more imported sounds and I also want to blend out a lot of the dialogue, and the transitions between sounds and effects.

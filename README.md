### Project Introduction

  My project is a scary story retelling that incoporates dialogue and sound effects. The story is of a woman living alone, when one night she gets a knock at the door from an unusual boy. My vision for the project is sort of an old-time creepy radio narrative. The story itself is pretty simple, but I wanted to write it in a way that would have lots of opportunities for playing with sound effects. 
  
  I always knew I wanted to do some sort of storytelling, but for my very first draft I chose to do a more serious spoken word piece. I really disliked the way it was going and how somber it was, so I ended up completely scrapping the first draft and putting together the scary story instead. I am so happy that I decided to do so, because I ended up really enjoying putting everything together. It wasn't completely a loss, because I was also able to take the audacity skills I learned in my first draft to my next draft! 
  
  Additional files in this repo include sources for any sounds that were not my own, a creator's statement, screenshots of my audacity file, and mp3/aup versions of my audio.

### Project description

  My project is a scary story retelling that incoporates dialogue and sound effects. The story is of a woman living alone, when one night she gets a knock at the door from an unusual boy. My vision for the project is sort of an old-time radio creepy radio narrative. I wrote the story, which is pretty simple, but had lots of good opportunities to play with sound effects. I really hope you enjoy it, and I had a lot of fun putting it together!
  
  Additional files in this repo include sources for any sounds that were not my own, a creator's statement, screenshots of my audacity file, and mp3/aup versions of my audio.

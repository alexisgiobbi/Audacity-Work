### Project description

  My project is a scary story retelling that incoporates dialogue and sound effects. The story is of a woman living alone, when one night she gets a knock at the door from an unusual boy. I wrote the story, which is pretty simple, but had lots of good opportunities to play with sound effects. 
  
  SOURCES.md is included to give credit for all sounds that are not my own.

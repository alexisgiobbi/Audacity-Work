# Composing-Digital-Media

### Project description

  So far, my project is a fake podcast/video series called the "Immersive Poetry Project Series" that features poetry accompanied by music and sound effects. The poem is something I wrote myself awhile ago, and revised for the project. 
  
  
### Progress so far 

  I have four tracks going so far- music, podcast intro, poem, and an effects track. I will be adding many more effects, different music, and a podcast outro.
